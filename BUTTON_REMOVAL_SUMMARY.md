# Button Removal Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to remove the "Raporu Getir" button while keeping the "Filtrele" button in both the Fatura Rapor (Invoice Report) and Ödeme Rapor (Payment Report).

## Changes Made

### 1. FaturaRaporu.tsx
- Removed the "Raporu Getir" button from the top action bar
- Kept the "Filtrele" button in the filter section
- Maintained all other functionality including PDF and Excel export buttons

### 2. OdemeRapor.tsx
- Removed the "Raporu Getir" button from the top action bar
- Kept the "Filtrele" button in the filter section
- Maintained all other functionality including PDF and Excel export buttons

## Technical Implementation

The changes involved removing the following button component from the `actions` section of both reports:

```tsx
<Button 
    onClick={fetchReportData}
    disabled={loading || selectedDonemler.length === 0}
    variant="primary"
>
    {loading ? 'Yükleniyor...' : 'Raporu Getir'}
</Button>
```

This button was redundant since the functionality was already available through the "Filtrele" button in the filter section.

## Benefits

1. **Simplified UI**: Removed redundant button to create a cleaner interface
2. **Consistency**: Both reports now have a consistent button layout
3. **User Experience**: Reduced confusion by having a single way to trigger report generation
4. **Maintainability**: Simplified the code by removing duplicate functionality

## Testing

Both reports have been tested to ensure:
- The "Filtrele" button continues to work correctly
- PDF and Excel export functionality remains intact
- All other report features work as expected
- No regressions were introduced by the changes

## Files Modified
- `CopyCat/pages/FaturaRaporu.tsx`
- `CopyCat/pages/OdemeRapor.tsx`

## Validation

The changes have been implemented following the UI streamlining preference, which favors individual assignment capability over bulk operations and emphasizes a clean, streamlined UI.
